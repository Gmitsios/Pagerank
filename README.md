# Pagerank
A Pagerank implementation using sequential code and PThreads.



Usage:

parallel: "filename.txt", number of nodes, number of edges, number of threads

sequential: same as parallel, just ignore number of threads input.


Appropriate data for this implementation can be found here: http://snap.stanford.edu/data/

(I used the amazon datasets)
