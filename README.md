# Pagerank
A Pagerank implementation using sequential code and PThreads.

Usage:
for parallel: "filename.txt", number of nodes, number of edges, number of threads
for sequential: "filename.txt", number of nodes, number of edges

Appropriate data for this implementation can be found here: http://snap.stanford.edu/data/
(I used the amazon datasets)
